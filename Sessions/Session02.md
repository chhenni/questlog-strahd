# Session 2


## The crypt
We found a room with a table and many bones. We got attacked by a small snake like thing with a beak and tentacles
** Picture **

## Ghouls!
Following the corridors further west, we ran into some ghouls.
Ill be completely honest. I dont remember much of the fight. I spent most of it on the floor with two ghouls piled on top of me. 
The ghouls seemed to still have some humanity left. Edwarn indicated that they might be liches(sp?)

## Altar
We came into a room with a altar.
Statue of a man in cloak
- Holds a orb - Smokey crystal
- Hand on wolf head
- Old/unfamiliar
- Gaunt pale face

Uppon further inspecting the room we find a trapdoor leading to the ground floor.
We further follow a corridor to the south and try to open a door

## Mimic
The door was not a door. It was a mimic.. With my hand in its mouth. With one hand in its mouth I sliced it with my sword continiously, while the rest of the party also attacked it. It seemed to work as it died. Still with my hand in its mouth.

## Ghasts
The next room we found worth mentioning was a bedroom, when we where peeking trough a chest two ghasts appepred. In the fight i got downed for the first time in this darned house. Elvira managed to force feed me a healing potion. So i pulled through.
The ghasts wore the same cloths as the parents in the picture on the first flore.
Atleast I got fancy new cloak from it.

## Further down
We decided to check out the eastern part of the dungion, on the way there I managed to fall into a spike trap. Elvira pulled me up with a rope, and Edwirn patched me together.

Whhen we got to the eastern wing and decended further down. We found multiple dorms for the cultists. Atleast we found some loot to bring out.
We travelled furhter down. 
The next room seemed to have been the scene of some dark rituals, I feel that we are getting closter to the bottom and more evil. 
The chanting we had heard since we got to the basement seemd to only grow stronger. 
Out of the room there where two exits, one had a slope down that lead to water, while the other lead to some cells. We tried the cells first, because none of us wanted to get wet.
It was empty but we found a hidden door that lead to the room with the water.
We tried to perform a flanking manouver where Elvira and Xyrith took the hidden door, while Eldwirn and I took the slope. 
When we got into the large room, we noticed a altar, and the voices where chanting "He is ancient, he is the land"
We noticed signes of a evil ritual on the altar.
The voices started calling for a sacrifice of blood, a life on the altar. We did not give it, and left the altar.
As we left the altar, the voices started summoning Lorgath the devourer

## Lorgath
A big blob of a creature appeared. I charged at it, to try to keep it pinned down. To try to keep the darned sourcerer and bard safe.
But Xyrith asked me to let it come further into the room. So I took a few steps back, loosing a opportunity to give a solid blow, or do something else that might have been useful.
This ofcourse panned out just as expected, Largoth ended up downing me. Atleast Xyrith healed me shortly after. 
Since im still writing we ofcourse mananged to kill it. It ended with my sword stabbed deep into the monster.


## Rats & Scythes
After Largoth was killed, it seemed like our business here was done. So we started on the way up to the surface. At first we tried to check the trapdoor, but the door out from the room blocked by scythes swinging across the doorway.The room is also filled with a wierdly plesantly smelling smoke.
Deciding that this way would be unvise we decieded to go all the way through the top off the house. Comming out of the stairwell, we noticed scythes in the doorway here as well. We all noticed that the house seemed to have decayed further while we where down in the dungeon, and the windows where boarded up. We all managed to get through the first set of scythe. Though not all unharmed. 

Uppon finding the next scythe Edwarn instead decided to go through it by punching a hole in the wall to the stairwell. He easily succeded in that. But when the wall breaks a swarm of rats come out from it. We fight them off and procede down.

The stategy is clear, avoid doorway, break walls. When we get to the second floor we repeat the demoliton and meet more rats. Xyrith charges into the next room and unleashes a swarm of thunder on the amasing rats. This succeeds in killing the rats off, but also breaks quite a few other doors. This in turn makes more rats appear from the cracked walls. So he decided to start jumping down the stairwell. The rest of us follow more or less elegantly, with rats following closly. We all manage to get down to the bottom floor more or less intact, Elvira takes a tumble and is incapacitated, but Xyrith manages to revive her. Elvira in a spark of genious runs to the outside wall, and breaks though giving us a exit. Eventually we all manage to get out to safety.


## Finally outside
As we all get out, we are still surrouned by the fog, but battered after the ordeal we decide to take a short rest. As we rest we notice the fog is lifting, and we see the town more clearly.
After our rest we start to investigate the city. 

As we start walking we notice several people walking around in the streets.

## Not to next session
- We want to ask the villagers where we are
