# Session 2


## The crypt
We found a room with a table and many bones. We got attacked by a small snake like thing with a beak and tentacles
** Picture **

## Ghouls!
Following the corridors further west, we ran into some ghouls.
Ill be completely honest. I dont remember much of the fight. I spent most of it on the floor with two ghouls piled on top of me. 
The ghouls seemed to still have some humanity left. Edwarn indicated that they might be liches(sp?)

## Altar
We came into a room with a altar.
Statue of a man in cloak
- Holds a orb - Smokey crystal
- Hand on wolf head
- Old/unfamiliar
- Gaunt pale face

Uppon further inspecting the room we find a trapdoor leading to the top floor.
We further follow a corridor to the south and try to open a door

## Mimic
The door was not a door. It was a mimic.. With my hand in its mouth. With one hand in its mouth I sliced it with my sword continiously, while the rest of the party also attacked it. It seemed to work as it died. Still with my hand in its mouth.

## Ghasts
The next room we found worth mentioning was a bedroom, when we where peeking trough a chest two ghasts appepred. In the fight i got downed for the first time in this darned house. Elvira managed to force feed me a healing potion. So i pulled through.
Atleast I got fancy new cloak from it.

## Further down
We decided to check out the eastern part of the dungion, on the way there I managed to fall into a spike trap.
