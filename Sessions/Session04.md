# Session 04

## Tavern
I shared a room with Edwarn. When waking up I inquired into a question I had been wondering about for a while: As far as Edwarn knows sleep shifting is not something thath happens.
I guess thats a good thing.

When we spoke he also asked if i heard a commotion during the night. He said there where lots of sounds and lights. I had not noticed that, but after the last days experences in the deathhouse I was tired.

Edwarn helped me on with my armour, he was quite quick, he seemed to have exprerence in these matters.
While helping me, he had a wierd outburst, followed by him saying "Your knife eared friend is in my head!". Appearently Elvira has some issues with normal boundries, and beeing polite.

## Mirabel
When we got downstairs, we all had some stew and started to chat with a lady named Mirabel.
We asked her about the commotions of last night, she said it was "The march of the dead". Appearently it does not harm anyone. But it is the Ghosts of the dead marching up to ravenloft castle.
I asked her about who or what the Vistani is.
Her reply is that they are Travellers, Drinkmakers, and offer services, for a price.
