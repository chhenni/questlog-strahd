# The road
When I meet Elivra and Xyrith in a tavern, I was preparing to travel towards Waterdeep from Neverwinter. The roads where reportedly quite unsafe with bandits roaming, so when they both said they where heading the same way i was relived.

We set out and the travels where uneventful, untill we got to a small town, where the tavern owner was hosting a tournament. We decided to join in as a team(see what i did there?)

We where supprised by the lack of competition in the first three rounds we fought. But in the final bout we faced a team concisting of a Half-Orc, a Human and a Aarakocra. 
The Human and the Aarakocra proved a bit weaker, but the Half-Orc proved to be a challenge, even though he tried to hide out behind a rock for the start of the tournament. 
That did not seem too honourable to me.
