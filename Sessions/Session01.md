# Session 01

# The road
When I meet Elivra and Xyrith in a tavern, I was preparing to travel towards Waterdeep from Neverwinter. The roads where reportedly quite unsafe with bandits roaming, so when they both said they where heading the same way i was relived.

We set out and the travels where uneventful, untill we got to a small town, where the tavern owner was hosting a tournament. We decided to join in as a team(see what i did there?)

We where supprised by the lack of competition in the first three rounds we fought. But in the final bout we faced a team concisting of a Half-Orc, a Human and a Aarakocra. 
The Human and the Aarakocra proved a bit weaker, but the Half-Orc proved to be a challenge, even though he tried to hide out behind a rock for the start of the tournament. 
That did not seem too honourable to me.
Regardless of the Half-Orcs cowardice we did indeed win the tournament, and got a nice paycheck of 15 GP and two healing potions

# The stranger
The same evening while we where basking in our glory from the tournament win. We meet a stranger who gave us a sealed letter

The seal was unknown to all of us, but we decided to open the letter
It read:

<blockquote> 
Hail to thee of might and valor.

I, a lowly servant of Barovia, send honor to thee. We plead for thy so desperately needed assistance.

The love of my life, Ireena Kolyana, has been afflicted by an evil so deadly that even the good people of our village cannot protect her. She languishes from her wound, and I would have her saved from this menace.

There is much wealth in this community. I offer all that might be had to thee and thy fellows if thou shalt but answer my desperate plea.

Come quickly, for her time is at hand! All that I have shall be thine!

Kolyan Indirovich
Burgomaster
