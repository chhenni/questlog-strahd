# Session 03


## Outside the death house
After getting out of the blasted house, we had a rest and a chat with Edwarn. Inquiring a bit more deeply into his experiences in this wierd land.
He told us that the game even more skittish here than he is used to. He recommends we dont eat the mushrooms, and whatever we do DONT GO INTO THE MIST!

After having the chat we start exploring the village

## The Village
Around the death house all the buildings are abandoned, but walking further into the village we noted that more houses seemed to have occupants. They where all in a state of disrepair.

While walking around trying to find someone to give us some directions, we noted a old woman with a cart. She seemd to be knocking on doors in the street. We tried to get her attention, but she ignored us and carried on.
We continued following her trying to catch up, while she continued knocking on doors. At last someone opened when she knocked. 


## Morgantha
We observed the interacton from a distance. It seemed like she came with a demand or tried to force them, and in return they ended up giving her their child. This i could not stand by to see, so i tried to intervene. But by the time I got to the house she was already on her way. I tried calling out for her to stop but like before she ignored us. This was promptly solved by Xyrith firing a arrow into her cart and snarling STOOOP! at her.

Finally she was willing to talk to us.
- She accepted to allow us to return the child to its family. 
- When we asked her about what land this is. She said that Strahd holds power here.
- She mention Vistani camps both to the west and the east.
- And to the west there is a city Valahi.
- She also mentions that Strahd has enemies. "Order of the silver dragon"
- The final thing she mentions is a rumor of a hidden temple containing forbidden lore. She said to get there we need to follow a long and winded path
- I also bought a mined meat pie. Im sure that will taste good

## Child returned
With the child safely in our custody, I thold it to go to its parents, it wearly skulked past me and returned inside. Afterwards i knocked on the door and a after a little while a man appeared.
He was very grateful for getting the child back and was willing to give us some more information.

- He thold us that the old lady who took his son is named Morgantha
- She gives the village protection against Strahd in exhange for a child every forthnight. 
- There have previously been attacks on the village that have increased in frequency, but they abruply stopped three days ago.
- When asked about the Death house, he said that it have been empty for atleast three generations.
- He warned us that trying to leave Borovia
- We also learned that his sons name is Anton

We also inquired into the village.
- There is a tavern named "Blood of the vine(or is wine)".
- There is a merchant Bildrars. Appearently he chages exchorborant prices.
- He also adviced us to stay away from Castle Ravenloft and Strahd.

Our next move was to go to the tavern to see if we could get some lodgings for the night.
