# Background
I had been on a long campaign as a soldier, and had seen the worst the battlefield had to offer, on both sides. The things i saw will haunt me til my death.. When I finally got home, I found my village ravaged and burned down. At that moment i snapped, and swore to get vengance on all those who do evil deeds. 


## The party
- Luz: Me - Human paladin
- Elvira Ithwileen - Highelv - Sorcerer
- Xyrith Umbyrphrael - Dragonborn - Bard
